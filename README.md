Script for the PPT:

Hello everyone! We’re the Astronomical Failures and we’re doing the CSA Radiation Challenge. Our task was to take raw radiation data collected by astronauts at the Space station as well as from schools across Canada and integrate and interpret them in a visually accessible manner for the average Canadian.

After collecting and organizing the raw data from schools, we removed all data points that were clearly false, and normalized the remainder to ensure they were comparable with the ISS data. We then researched further data on other sources of radiations for the same locations, and set out to build a visual tool to make it all easily accessible.

This tool helps us improve future data collection program in schools, and immediately filters out any entries that would affect the reliability and accuracy of the findings. Giving students a tangible experience in scientific data collection will help to inspire the next generation of scientists who will improve our understanding of the world.

And of course, creating a tool that makes this data accessible to an average person who may not be familiar with various types of radiation helps them stay informed of their living environment and the impact it can have on their lives. We’re really excited to give a live demo of how informative,  powerful and easy to navigate the tool we’ve built is.
